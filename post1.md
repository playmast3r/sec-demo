This combination of automated and expert-driven manual testing ensures the best end-result for your web-applications.

Our in-house developed E.D.I.T.E framework takes our experienced consultants through a well-defined testing workflow that intelligently automates repeatable tasks while facilitating auditors to efficiently carry out thorough manual testing.
